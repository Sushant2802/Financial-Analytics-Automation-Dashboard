# üìä Financial Analysis Project

This project demonstrates **end-to-end financial analytics automation and visualization** using **Power BI, Power Query, Python, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**.  
It solves **real-world business problems** by automating data ingestion, cleaning, transformation, and building interactive dashboards.

## üöÄ Project Overview

- **Client**: US Government  
- **Workflow Challenge**:  
  Each day ~25 data files were received via email (~3 PM) from a distributed survey team, and the dashboard had to be built & delivered by 8 PM.  
  The manual process was **time-consuming, error-prone, and costly ($12,000/month)**.

- **Objective**:  
  - Automate the data pipeline (Email ‚Üí Power BI)  
  - Reduce turnaround time  
  - Minimize errors  
  - Cut costs & improve efficiency

## ‚ö° Workflow Automation

The automated pipeline:

```
Email ‚Üí Power Automate ‚Üí Google Drive ‚Üí GCP API ‚Üí Python Script ‚Üí Power BI
```

### Steps:
1. **Email Rule Setup**: Outlook mail rule filters relevant analytics emails into a dedicated folder.  
2. **Power Automate**: Automatically transfers attachments to Google Drive.  
3. **Google Drive API**: Secure access to only the "Financial Project" folder.  
4. **Python Script (Power BI Desktop)**: Fetches & concatenates all files.  
5. **Power Query**: Cleans and preprocesses data for dashboarding.

## üßπ Data Cleaning Process (Power Query)

Key transformations:
- Handled missing/invalid values (`No Information`, `Data Missing`)  
- Fixed outliers in **Age, Bank Accounts, Credit Cards, Interest Rate**  
- Created new features like **monthly_in_hand_salary**, **credit history in months**, and **age bins**  
- Processed **loan types** into structured data
